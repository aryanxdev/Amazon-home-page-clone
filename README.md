# Amazon-home-page-clone
--cloned the homepage of amazon.com using pure html and css
--did this to practice and revise the concepts I learned in the HTML-CSS course, for example:texts, buttons, grids, flexbox, position, layouts, etc..
--did this from complete scratch without any guidance form anyone and i feel good about it
--took me 3 days to code the project
--was really helpful
